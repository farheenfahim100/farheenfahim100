# About me 😁

I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Warwick. I am working towards my BSc, but am also hoping to complete an MSc in the field. I have experience in coding in the following programming languages:

- Python
- Java
- C
- Haskell
- HTML/CSS/Javascript


# My projects 📚

## Ticket/Event System Website 🎟️

During my Web Development module in my first year of University, I had to complete the task of creating a website which allows a superuser to add events, and allows users to request/reserve tickets for events. This involved creating a login system for users, a database for storing event, ticket, and user information, multiple web pages so that users can navigate the website easily, and more. 

I created this website using Flask/Python. Additionally, I learnt more about HTML, CSS styling, JavaScript, AJAX, SQLite and used all of these within this project. 

## London Tube Journey Planner Website 🚊

During Year 13, I completed this project as part of my Computer Science A-Level. This involved creating a website in which users are able to input their current location and their destination tube station. Then, the program returns the fastest route between those 2 stations and tells the user which line they must take, and the estimated time the journey will take. Additionally, the user could see information about different tube lines (e.g, disruptions and delays) and different stations (e.g, out of order lifts, toilet facilities). This information was provided through the use of an API. 

Since the project, I have not had much time to improve on this project and add new things I have learnt more recently, but this basic project was a great achievement which is functional and it demonstrates my abilities from a few years ago. Even though I have improved my skills in coding and web development, this project remains useful since it was coded using Dijkstra's algorithm, which is being covered within modules I am taking in my second year of University.
